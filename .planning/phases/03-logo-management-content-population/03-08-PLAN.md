<objective>
Acquire and store logos for ecosystem entries.

Purpose: Add visual branding to ecosystem entries by downloading logos from project websites and storing them locally.

Output: Logo images in public/logos/, JSON entries updated with logo paths.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Attempt automated logo fetching for known sources</name>
  <files>public/logos/*</files>
  <action>
Attempt to fetch logos from known, reliable sources. Some projects have predictable logo URLs:

**GitHub projects (use raw githubusercontent):**
- For repos like `github.com/coinbase/x402`, check for:
  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coinbase/x402/main/logo.png`
  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coinbase/x402/main/assets/logo.png`
  - Favicon from docs site

**Known logo URLs to try:**
1. Coinbase/x402 projects (x402-fetch, example gallery, etc.) - use x402.org favicon or Coinbase logo
2. thirdweb - `https://thirdweb.com/favicon.ico` or their brand assets
3. Pinata - `https://pinata.cloud/favicon.ico`
4. Firecrawl - `https://firecrawl.dev/favicon.ico`

For each successful download:
1. Save to `public/logos/{entry-slug}.{ext}` (png preferred, svg acceptable)
2. Optimize if larger than 50KB (resize to 100x100 or similar)
3. Update the corresponding JSON file's `logo` field to `"/logos/{entry-slug}.{ext}"`

Use curl or wget to download. Skip entries where logo URL is not obviously available.

Focus on high-visibility entries first:
- Client-Side: thirdweb, x402-fetch
- Services: Firecrawl, Pinata, Neynar
- Infrastructure: thirdweb, OpenFacilitator, x402scan

**Expected outcome:** 5-15 logos downloaded automatically.
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# List downloaded logos
ls -la public/logos/

# Count logos (excluding .gitkeep)
ls public/logos/*.{png,svg,ico,jpg} 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# Check file sizes
du -h public/logos/*
```
  </verify>
  <done>
- Some logos downloaded to public/logos/
- Files are reasonable size (< 50KB each)
- JSON entries updated for successfully downloaded logos
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Verify logos display correctly</name>
  <what-built>Logo infrastructure with automated downloads for available logos</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `pnpm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Scroll to "Who's Building" section
4. Check that:
   - Entries WITH logos show the logo image
   - Entries WITHOUT logos show the first-letter fallback
   - No broken image icons
   - Logos are appropriately sized (not stretched/distorted)
5. Count how many logos are displaying vs fallbacks
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if logos display correctly.

If you want more logos, provide a list of priority entries and we can attempt to source them manually, OR you can add logos yourself by:
1. Download logo from project website
2. Save to public/logos/{slug}.png
3. Update data/ecosystem/{category}/{slug}.json to set "logo": "/logos/{slug}.png"
  </resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Final JSON updates and build verification</name>
  <files>data/ecosystem/**/*.json</files>
  <action>
After checkpoint approval:

1. Verify all JSON files still parse correctly
2. Run full build to ensure no issues
3. Count total logos vs total entries for summary

```bash
# Count entries with logos
grep -r '"logo": "/logos' data/ecosystem/ | wc -l

# Count total entries
ls data/ecosystem/**/*.json | wc -l
```
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# Build must pass
pnpm run build

# All JSON files valid
for f in data/ecosystem/**/*.json; do
  python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('$f'))" || echo "INVALID: $f"
done
```
  </verify>
  <done>
- All JSON files valid
- Build passes
- Logo count documented
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Build passes: `pnpm run build` completes
2. Logo directory populated: `ls public/logos/` shows image files
3. No broken images in browser
4. Fallback works for entries without logos
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- LOGO-02: Logo paths referenced in entry JSON files
- POP-05: Logos downloaded and stored locally (at least high-priority ones)
- All logos display correctly in UI
- Fallback displays for entries without logos
- Build passes
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-logo-management-content-population/03-08-SUMMARY.md`

Include in summary:
- Total entries: X
- Entries with logos: Y
- Entries using fallback: Z
- List of logos acquired
</output>
