## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- JSON/YAML files per entry for easier PR reviews
- Keep facilitators separate (current design works)
- Local logos only to ensure availability
- Populate all x402.org entries for comprehensive starting point
- Used explicit null for logo fields (clarifies logos pending for Phase 3)
- Use synchronous fs methods for build-time data loading
- Return empty array when category missing (graceful degradation)
- Use Context API instead of prop drilling (02-01)
- Create modular client components vs single HomeClient component (02-01)
